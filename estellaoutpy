1. Create an SSH tunnel between login node and computing node. In a cluster terminal, enter:

    ssh -N -L 8787:localhost:40657 ydong2@dnaXXX

Notes:
    - If port 8787 is occupied, cancel the command, change port to another unused port between 1024 and 65535 and relaunch the command
    - Do not forget to change dnaXXX to the actual compute node. Use 'Squeue' and look at 'NODELIST(REASON)' to get value of 'XXX'

2. Redirect Rstudio or Jupyter Lab session to your web browser. In a local terminal (i.e not on the cluster), enter:

    ssh -N -L 8787:localhost:8787 username@curnagl.dcsr.unil.ch

Note: do not forget to adapt the port number to the value you chose in 1.

3. Access Rstudio or Jupyter Lab session by entering 'http://localhost:8787' in your web browser.

4. Log in to Jupyter Lab using the following credentials:

    user: ydong2
    password: Oqnm8agt3uPZcACwJPzI

Note: for Jupyter Lab, you need to use the token in this file. Search the file for the word 'token' to find it.

5. When done using Jupyter Lab, terminate the job by:

    5.1. Exit Jupyter Lab session ("power" button in top right corner of Jupyter Lab window)
    5.2. Enter following command on login node:

    scancel -f 45137577
